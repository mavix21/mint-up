1. ALWAYS BE CONCISE AND TO THE POINT
   Do not create unnecessary files, no summary report, no summary of the code,
   no readme files, no example files, no test files, no documentation files.

2. DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES UNTIL I APPROVE THEM
   You must always ask me for approval before making any changes, unless I ask you to do so right away.

3. PLAN YOUR CHANGES BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM
   Before making any changes, you must plan them thoroughly.
   I need to know what you are going to do and WHY you are doing it.

4. STICK TO THE PLAN AND DO NOT MAKE UNNECESSARY CHANGES
   Once you have planned your changes, you must stick to the plan and do not make unnecessary changes.
